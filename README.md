# angular-REST Client — using AngularJS

This project is an Advanced REST Client designed for developers to test their REST services


### Running the app during development

You can pick one of these options:

* serve this repository with your webserver
* install node.js and run `scripts/web-server.js`

Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:<port>/app/index.html` to see the app running in
your browser.


### Running unit tests

We recommend using [jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) and
[Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), Karma (`sudo npm install -g karma`) and a local
or remote browser.

* start `scripts/test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\test.bat`)
  * a browser will start and connect to the Karma server (Chrome is default browser, others can be captured by loading the same url as the one in Chrome or by changing the `config/karma.conf.js` file)
* to run or re-run tests just change any of your source or test javascript files


### End to end testing

We recommend using [protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) for end-to-end tests. It
uses native events and has special features for Angular applications.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run:
  * run the tests from console with [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\e2e-test.bat`)
